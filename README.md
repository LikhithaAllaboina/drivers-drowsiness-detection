# drivers-drowsiness-detection
detecting drivers drowsiness using big data and deep learning

Abstract: Out of all the accidents that occur in India it is estimated that 40% of the accidents occur due to drowsiness of the drivers. Our main objective of this project is to detect the pattern of accidents using the images taken from different angles for the drivers classify them using deep learning models and implement them in real time and check if our implementation is actually working. We will be using Python to show our modelling and real time experimenting and we will also show how we are going to alert the driver who would possibly be in danger if they become drowsy while driving in any situations with help of alarm system.

Key Words: Drowsiness detection, CNN, Transfer learning, Real Time implementation

Introduction:
Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a system that was made to detect the driverâ€™s drowsiness. the number of accidents that are occurring due to drivers being drowsy, during night shift or being drunk are increasing day by day and in this project we are trying to implement ways in which we can detect the driver feeling sleepy and alert him using an alarm. Here we are using deep learning and computer vision to make the training and real time implementation possible. The dataset we are using is image dataset and it has the images of people in different angles. The images are classified into four categories:  opened eyes, closed eyes, yawning and no yawning.

The deep learning algorithm we are using is CNN. The practise of reusing previously trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models for a new task is known as CNN transfer learning. This technique has gained favour in recent years due to the high computational cost of training large-scale CNN models from scratch.
In transfer learning, a pre-trained CNN model is used as a starting point for a new job, such as image categorization or object recognition. The pre-trained model has typically been trained on a large dataset, such as ImageNet, and has learned a set of feature representations helpful for a variety of computer vision tasks.
Transfer learning is frequently used to replace the final classification layer with a new classification layer that is specific to the new task. The weights of the previously trained layers are then frozen, and only the weights of the new classification layer are updated during training.
Transfer learning can lower the amount of labelled training data required for a new task while also enhancing the model's generalisation performance. It's a powerful technique that's been used in a wide range of applications, including image classification, object recognition, and semantic segmentation.
